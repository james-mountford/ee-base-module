# EE Base Module

A simple base module for EE, on which a full module cna be built.

The name `module_base` is used throughout, so you can use your favorite
method to find and replace the existing module name with your own. Just
remember to do a case sensitive replacement, as in some instances EE
requires that the first letter of the module name be capitalised 
(mostly for class names).
